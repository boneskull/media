			<h3>S04E06 A Tune for Two<span class="year">1986-02-10</span><span class="rating label label-warning pull-right">0.0</span></h3>
			<p class="plot">It's time for the Duet-athon! Wembley's supposed to be paired up with Gobo, but when Matt comes back home for another visit, Gobo gets paired up with his uncle instead. Then Wembley tries to get Boober to join him, but when Tosh Fraggle comes along, Boober just can't resist doing a song with his crush. Wembley becomes sad, and thinks no one wants to be with him in the Duet-athon. While Wembley's crying, Cotterpin Doozer comes along and tries to cheer him up, saying she'll be in the competition with him. When Wembley then goes to Gillis Fraggle to sign her up as his partner, Gillis rudely tells him Doozers are not allowed in the contest. Wembley goes back and delivers the bad news to Cotterpin, saying she can't be in it with him. She gets mad and leaves, prompting Wembley to stand up to Gillis, telling him that just because the Duet-athon has always been just for Fraggles, it doesn't make it right. He starts up a protest rally, and before long, all the Fraggles say that if Cotterpin isn't allowed to join, they'll all drop out, leaving Gillis no choice but to do the right thing... leading to the greatest Duet-athon ever</p>
