In Mintern, Justin continues his mesmerizing evil sermons to his Temple of Jericho congregation where he has a seizure when he has a vision of the threat that Ben poses to him. In Los Moscos, New Mexico, Stroud reports his progress to Justin who advises him to turn his search to looking for Ben Hawkins. Iris tries to cover-up her own secrets from Dolan while imploring Justin not to keep secrets from her.
