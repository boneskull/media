			<h3>S04E09 Wembley's Flight<span class="year">1986-03-03</span><span class="rating label label-warning pull-right">0.0</span></h3>
			<p class="plot">When Wembley rescues a Spider Fly from a Snare Blossom, the fly turns into a strange old creature that will grant Wembley any wish he wants to for setting him free. Wembley decides he wants to fly, so the creature gives him the ability, but Wembley's only allowed to fly three times. He uses his first time up almost immediately, but then he goes to find his friends to show them his new ability. Wembley's story isn't quite believable to his friends, which upsets Wembley because everyone else gets to show off what they're good at. He decides he's going to fly for the Fraggles who will believe him... so he seeks out Feeny, Marlon, and Large Marvin to show them his flying abilities. But Gobo, Mokey and Red stop him from doing so because they believe he'll just hurt himself. Finally, he decides that showing off for his friends isn't what he wanted the flying abilities for; he wanted to fly just to fly.</p>
