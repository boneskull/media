			<h3>S04E12 Space Frog Follies<span class="year">1986-03-24</span><span class="rating label label-warning pull-right">0.0</span></h3>
			<p class="plot">Gobo's getting ready to have a surprise party for himself, but when Uncle Matt shows up and says he can't come to the party, Gobo gets upset. Meanwhile, Matt takes Wembley aside and shows him the present he got for Gobo; a space frog. Matt then tells him that he wants Wembley to watch over it until he gets back from "Outer Space" so he can collect flies for the frog to eat. So it's up to Wembley to keep the space frog a secret until Matt gets back, but he has a hard time doing so. But is keeping the space frog in a jar, as a pet, for the rest of his life really the best thing for him? It's up to Wembley to decide what's best for the space frog, even if it means upsetting his buddy.</p>
